Script to mass-update system standing penalties

This script can be useful after a configuration/policy change
to the system standing penalty thresholds.

For example, if a patron owes $11 and the old threshold for
PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES was $10, and the new limit is $15, this
script can be used to update all affected patrons so that
they no longer have the standing penalty applied.

This script requires a list of patron IDs (example SQL query
can be found in the comments), an Evergreen session token,
and can be pointed at your Evergreen server's /osrf-gateway-v1
endpoint.
